<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey, im Luiz Enrique, Computer Engineering student in the UPE (Peranmbuco's university) If you are reading this page it is because I managed to venture into web development. But 
  my place is in the Machine Learning and Computal Vision. However, learning is never too much, and i like this, i like know abaout the things and know do the things.
</p>

<p>So, this page is called "About Me" so I will talk more about me. I'm 21 years old, live in Brazil and I always wanted to study and work with science to make a difference in
  the world. And in my adolescence, I decided to do that using the technology, because its fast evolution and develope, it has a big power to change. And that's why, im here, writing
    this to show to you, dear reader a bit of my jobs and studies. </p>

<p>Im propably not the master of developer, but i always will want do the best and learn with the process, im believe that is the way. Isen't about do the task perfectly and quickly
  its about enjoy the way, and that will be you a master dev, learn with the troubles, and always look for more, never be content with what you have and do.I think that if I follow this way, I will get where I want.
